# BBC Educational App
This is my first group completed with two of my peers over 7days. We used JavaScript with Vue and JavaScript Libraries such as Leaflet to create a Map. 
This was an opportunity for us to not only further enhance our development skills but also our GitHub and team-working skills while using Agile methods.

## Brief
The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

## MVP
A user should be able to: view some educational content on a particular topic be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content

### Extensions
Use an API to bring in content of a database to store information. 
Use charts or maps to display your information to the page. 
API, Libraries, Resources https://www.highcharts.com/ HighCharts is an open-source library for rendering responsive charts. https://leafletjs.com/ Leaflet is an open-source library for rendering maps and map functionality.

### Features I'd like to implement in the future:
*	To improve the map functionality that will allow the user to see the exact location of the country after being selected from the dropdown menu. Currently an arrow will indicate the location, however the user still needs to manouver the map to see this arrow. I would like this to be a more automatic function.
*	I would like to add futher content to the page, such as more information for the user on the Homepage.
*	The leader board was added very last minute so I would like to improve the look and location on the page to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
